# Open-Drift

The Open Drift platform strives to create an Open-Source alternative to the scarce but growing 1/24 drift scene.
We aspire to have an open and welcoming community with a vast and expansive aftermarket scene.
Everyone is free to adjust, adapt and customize the platform to their needs or produce hop ups to their hearts content.
Want to make aluminium or carbon fibre hop ups? sure! Want to sell them? sure!

Our initial chassis will be the: OMD 1.0 RWD chassis 1/24th scale, the goal is to have an entirely 3D printable base (minus drive train components) to make it cheap and accessible.
